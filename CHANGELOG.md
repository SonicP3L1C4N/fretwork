# Changelog

## Unreleased — P0

- **The spike works end to end.** `spike/gp2midi.py` reads a Guitar Pro 7/8
  file, reconstructs the score from the flat id-referenced arrays gpif stores
  it in, expands repeats into a played timeline, and writes a standard MIDI
  file. `--stems` renders one WAV per track through FluidSynth, plus a mix,
  which is the project's whole premise demonstrated in 350 lines of throwaway
  Python. Confirmed the only way it can be: by listening to it.
- Verified against eleven Guitar Pro 8.1.3 and 8.1.4 scores: 1,451 bars, 9,157
  beats, 3,002 notes. All parse. *Horses* renders to 4:52 against a real track
  length of 4:53, which is the tempo map, the time signatures and the note
  durations all agreeing at once.
- **`docs/architecture.md`** — the stack, defined and argued: C++20 with Qt6 and
  KF6, Rust behind a C ABI for the importers, FluidSynth per track, lilv for
  per-track LV2 chains, PipeWire out. Includes the two engine rules that are
  cheap now and expensive later: one MIDI channel per string, and an engine
  that knows only how to fill N frames at sample position T.
- **`docs/gpif-format.md`** — how a `.gp` file is really put together, measured
  rather than assumed, including the three traps: beats are deduplicated across
  the whole score, the track transpose is for display and must not reach
  playback, and a drum kit is identified by instrument type rather than by its
  programme number, which is 0 and means acoustic piano.
